<h2> Margin </h2>
<p> The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, 
outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the 
margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an 
element (top, right, bottom, and left).</p>
    
<h2> Border </h2>
<p> All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" 
is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially 
a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, 
padding, and the actual content. In this case this would be the border.</p>
    
<h2> Padding </h2>
<p> The padding property in CSS defines the innermost portion of the box model, 
creating space around an element's conten, inside of any defined margins and/or
borders. Padding values are set using lengths or percentages, and cannot accept
negative values. The initial, or default, value for all padding properties 
is 0.</p>

<h2> Content </h2>
<p> The CSS Box Model. All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, 
the term "box model" is uded when talking about design and layout. The CSS box 
model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists 
of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. In this case this 
would be the content.</p>
    
<div class=padding1><p>In this first padding div I set the padding on all sides 
the same. I set the background color to a salmon type color with  yellowish 
dashed border line that is 2px. I set the width to 720px and had the padding 
all set to 10px. </p></div>
    
<div class=padding2><p> In the second padding div I set the padding on the top 
and bottom to one size and the right and left to a different size. I set the 
background color to a light brownish color. With a salmon type border dashed 
line that is 2px. I then had the width set to 620px. With padding top and bottom
are the same and then right and left were the same. Starting at top and bottom 
I set them at 20px. Then with the right and left I set them at 30px.</p></div>
    
<div class=padding3><p>In the third padding div set the padding of the top, 
right, bottom, and left teach to a different size. I set the background color 
to a greenish color. With a border dashed line that is also a greenish color 
that is 2px. The width is 520px with the padding all a different size.</p></div>
    
<div class=margin1><p>For this first margin div I left the left margin at 
its default value (I didn't set the margin property). I set the background 
color to a dark grayish color. The border is dark blue color that is dashed 
and 2px. With a width of 400px, padding to 25px, and the left margin at its 
defaut value (didn't set the margin property). </p></div>
    
<div class=margin2><p>For this second margin div I set the left margin to a 
value between 40-60. I set the background color to a blueish type color. 
With a red border dashed line that is 2px. The padding is set to 25px 
and left margin to a value of 50px.</p></div>

<div class=margin3><p>For this third margin div I set the left margin to value 
between 100-180. I set the background color to a purple type color. With a light
pinkish coor as the the border that is dashed and 2px. The width is 400px, 
padding 25px, and left margin to a value of 150px.</p></div>
    
<h2> What it Means to "Hover" in CSS </h2>
<p>The :hover selector is a pseudo-class that allows you to target an certain 
element. Which the cursor or mouse pointing thingy is hovering over. In many 
situations it can be difficult to apply the :hover selector on touch devices. 
Starting in IE4, the :hover selector could only be used with "a" tags. Since 
IE7, the :hover seletor can be used with all of the elements.</p>
    
<div class=hover1><p>Hello I am hover one. I am number one and always number 
one. Because one rocks.</p></div>

<div class=hover2><p>Hello I am hover two. I am number two and always number 
two. Because two rocks.</p></div>

<div class=hover3><p>Hello I am hover three. I am number three and always number
three. Because three rocks.</p></div>
