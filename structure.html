<h1>Ball Is Life</h1>

<p>My favorite sport by far would be basketball. I have been playing basketball
since the day I could walk. It's my passion and would anything for the game.
My favorite team would be the Los Angeles Lakers only because LeBron James 
plays for that team. I played varsity basketball ever since the 8th grade and
also AAU basketball since the age of 8 years old. What I love about the game
the most that it teaches you a lot about life. One, it teaches you how to trust
your players. If you can't trust your players how are you going to win. Same
with many aspects in life, for example if you can't trust your wife how are you
going to get through life together. Two, it teaches you how to trust yourself
it different areas in the game, whether that's shooting a shot or getting put
into the game in a crucial time. This relates to many different aspects in life,
for example, driving for the first time, if you can't or don't trust yourself
how are you going to be able to drive on the streets or in the neighborhood.
Lastly, it teaches you how to control your temper at times. For example, 
when someone is fouling you multiple times it teaches you how to control
your anger or you will either get a technical foul or maybe even get ejected
out of the game. This relates to life, for example, school if you hit someone
that could get you in some serious trouble, whether that get set to detention
or even get suspended. </p>

<p>I started playing Amateur Athletic Union also known as AAU since the start
of 3rd grade until about sophomore year in high school. AAU basketball is
for really skilled players that are looking to play college ball in the 
future, but not just anyone can play AAU you have to be selected. It's
relatable to like junior high sports and high school sports. The reason
why I stopped playing AAU my sophomore year was to focus on my high school 
years in basketball. Some AAU teams I have played for would be Metro,
DASH, Farmington, and Bingham. And the schools I played for are North
Layton Junior High, and Northridge High. I had a great experience playing
ball for many many years, but after my senior year I got really sick to
the point where I gave up playing ball for little. Which I mean was a 
good wake up call to myself to think about my career and what I want to do
with it, which was when I started to really enjoy coding and just the different
aspects in a computer.</p>
    
<p>I started to build an interest in computers going into my 2nd semester 
here at Weber State Univerisity (Spring 2016). My major at first was 
Communications, the reason why I changed it was first I saw that you can't 
really make much with a Communications degree unless you get a Masters in it or 
higher, which for me I don't want to go to school for that long. At the same 
time I wasn't really passionate about the major. So I had a talk with my parents
and basically we talked about my interests and that lead to me majoring in
Computer Science and ever since my 2nd semester here at Weber State I have
been a CS major and so far I am loving it.</p>
