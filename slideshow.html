<p>NBA 2K is a series of basketball video games. It was developed and first released in the year 1999 on the Dreamcast. The premise of each game in the series is to emulate the sport of basketball, in other words the National Basketball Association (NBA), and to present improvements every year. All of the games in the series have been developed by Visual Concepts. In addition to, the first games were published by Sega before the company sold Visual Concepts to a company named Take Two Interactive, which they formed 2K Sports. </p>
    
<p>Throuout the years they have introduced many game modes to the game. For example, "career mode", which has been described as a sports-themed role-playing mode. It really made success in NBA 2K10 and became a more integral part of the series. Therefore, after NBA 2K10 came out they introduced MyCareer (career mode), MyPark, and MyTeam. Once people experienced those different modes, 2K really took over the basketball video game industry and games like NBA Live were no match compared to NBA 2K.</p>
    
<p>What is MyCareer? In MyCareer, you have the chance to create your own NBA player. Depending on how the storyplot is you can either be an overseas basktball player, a college athlete, or just a regular guy just trying to make it to the league. After that you are then drafted and become a bench player on the team where you must work your way up. Either that is to be a star, superstar, or one of the greatest NBA players to ever play the game. In the the newer games of NBA 2K (NBA 2K16-2K19) there are cutscenes which tell a specific story about your player. The ultimate end goal is to meer the Hall of Fame (HOF) requirements and retire. Unless you are into myPark!</p>
    
<p>What is MyPark? MyPark is a game mode that started in NBA 2K15, where you can play against other people online using your myPlayer that you created in myCareer. The first few years (2K15-2K17) you were able to pick between 3 parks; Old Town Flyers, Rivet City Rough Riders, and the Sunset Beach Ballers. After 2K17, they introduced what is called "The Neighborhood". In the neighborgood you will also find other online myPlayers and real life NBA players, but you will be able to do a lot more. For instance, you will find shops, the G Training Facility, the Team Training Facility, your MyCourt, The Venue, VC Sports Management, and Pro-AM Team Arena. When they introduced MyPark, 2K really won the battle between them and Live, because in Live they didn't have this mode where you can create your own player and have him go against online players. </p>

<p>What is MyTeam? MyTeam is a game mode that allows you to build your own team, consisting of former, current, or your own player (if you created one). You have the ability to customize your team's franchise and appearance. Whether that is jerseys/shorts, arena, logo, name, etc. In addition to, MyTeam has several different game modes inside of it, which include blacktop, domination, challenges, freestyle, triple threat, and multiplayer. MyTeam was first introduced in 2K13, and since then it has changed drastically. For example, the amount of former players they have added. Players like Greg Oden, Andre Miller, Mo Williams, and Elton Brand. </p>
