<h1>How to Upload to Icarus Server</h1>

<p>So first off you will need to have a server. So we can store your files on a 
    machine that is specifically a web server. What web servers do is they store 
    files and wait for requests, and when a request comes they return the file. 
    A request can come when you type in a specific URL. And when you type in a 
    URL it returns that file. So to get server space here at WSU the CS 
    department has provided everyone in a CS class their own server space and 
    it's on the server called "Icarus".

<h2>Steps on how to make an account</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>www.weber.edu/cs (should take you to the main page of the CS)</li>
		<li>Click on technical support</li>
		<li>Scroll down until you see "Default Login Help" (click it)</li>
		<li>Scroll down until you see Default Login Tool (click it)</li>
		<li>Enter your first and last name and including your W Number 
        (click submit)</li> 
		<li>The one we are going to use is the green one. (Icarus/Linux)</li> 
	</ol>
<h3>How to move your files</h3>
<p>So then we need to be able to move our files. What we need is a File Transer 
Protocol Client (FTP). For example, you can download Cyberduck, which is a FTP 
client you can download for free. It is great, because it supports many 
platforms (windows, mac, linux). There are many out there so feel free to use 
the one you are most comfortable with.</p>

<h3>Once you have downloaded Cyberduck</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on Open Connection</li>
        <li>Change protocol to SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) Port 22 </li>
        <li>Type in server information (icarus.cs.weber.edu)</li>
        <li>Type in username and password</li>
        <li>Click connect</li>
    </ol>

<h3>How to upload your files/folders</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go into public_html folder</li>
        <li>After that you can drag and dropyour files into that file once you 
        have clicked on the public_html folder</li>
        <li>Another way is you can click the upload button</li>
        <li>It is also the same if you wanted to drap and drop an entire folder</li>
    </ol>
