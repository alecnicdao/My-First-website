<h2> CS 2350 </h2>
<p> What is CS 2350? CS 2350 is basically an Web Development course. Web 
    Development is the work involved in developing a web site for the intranet, 
    or as we say "the Internet". Web Development can range from developing a 
    simple single basic web page of plain text to a more complex web-based 
    internet applications, electronic buinesses, and social network services. 
    Taking this course you will be able to create web pages that meets published
    standards using HTML 5, CSS,. You will be able to use CSS to add style to a 
    web page, with that create a basic web site using navigation to connect 
    multiple pages together. Using CSS you will understand how to use it to 
    style web pages and websites. Lastly, you will create interactive web pages 
    using client-side JavaScript programming. In other words, use the jQuery 
    framework to add functionality to a website.</p>

<h2> HTML </h2>
<p>What is HTML? First, HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the 
    standard markup language for all Web pages. HTML is used to create 
    electronic documents, which are called "pages" that are displayed on the 
    World Wide Wed (WWW). Without HTML, a browser on the internet would not know
    how to display text as elements or load images/other elements and have style
    to it for certain functions to work.</p>
<p> HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a program to design your
    web site. For example, many people use Notepad/Notepad++, TextEdit, or 
    Brackets. When you design your website you don't just start typing like it's
    a WORD document. There are certain guidelines and tags you have to follow 
    in order for your webpage to function properly.</p>

<h2> CSS </h2>
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is a series of instructions called 
    statements. A statement does two things: it identifies the elements in an 
    HTML document that it affects. The difference between CSS and HTML is that 
    HTML is used to create the actual content of the web page, for example, all 
    the information you want to write down. In CSS it is duty is to design or 
    style the web page, including the layout, visual effects and background 
    color. Without CSS you wouldn't see such unique webpages, all you would see 
    is a black and white page with information on it.</p>

<h2> jQuery </h2>
<p> According to Google, jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", 
    JavaScript library. In other words, the purpose of jQuery is to make it much
    more simple for users to use JavaScript on your Website. Javascript is a 
    programming language unlike jQuery, where it is a framework to help us write
    in Javascript. It is useful, because it is simply traversing the DOM in an 
    HTML page. In order to learn jQuery you will have to learn JavaScript, 
    because you will run into problems where you would have to understand both 
    in order for your program/webpage to function properly.</p>
